# YADrone Recorder
Yet Another Drone Framework (for the AR.Drone 2)<br/>
This is a fork of the YADrone project. <br/>
It allows users to save the navdata and commands to a file so that they can be read and analysed later. <br/>
Recorder plugin is available in the YADrone Control Center. Data are saved as csv or tsv.<br/>
Recorder interface is accessible from the YADrone framework.<br/>
Apart from that:<br/>
Many bugs from the original YaDrone Framework have been fixed.<br/>
Decreased Control Center start-up time.<br/>
Added ability to reconnect the drone without having to restart whole Control Center application.<br/>
(Restart button on the Connection State Plugin Panel.)<br/>
